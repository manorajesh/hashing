mhash [--length 32] [PLAINTEXT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
mhash hashing the plaintext with the default length of 32 characters. The hashing algorithm is custom made and tested minimally for collisions.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs; however, the hashing algorithm is not collision tested rigorously, so do NOT use this for any secure purposes.
